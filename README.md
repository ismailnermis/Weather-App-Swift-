# Weather-App-Swift-
In this project I used Firebase.
Usage of Firebase, Protocols, Extensions, MVC.

NOTICE: 
In Hava Durumu/Model/WeatherManager.swift line17 :
- let weatherURL = "API KEY from https://api.openweathermap.org" -
You must use a valid API KEY. In this project I used from https://api.openweathermap.org
You can creat an account and get API Key for your project.
